## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

This game was one of my **first freelancing projects** years ago, originally designed as a **professional 2D side-scrolling adventure** with deep mechanics. 

The original version featured a **storage system for coins**, **multiple levels**, and over **10 unique samurai characters**, each with **different abilities and animations**. My goal was to create a **fast-paced, engaging combat experience** while ensuring a rewarding progression system.

As I developed this game, I focused on refining **fluid combat mechanics**, balancing **enemy AI**, and crafting an experience that felt both challenging and rewarding. Bringing it to **Android and iOS** required additional optimizations, but in the end, the final product was something I was proud to deliver.

This project remains a **milestone in my freelancing career**, showcasing how my skills evolved and how I tackled complex gameplay mechanics early in my journey. 🚀
